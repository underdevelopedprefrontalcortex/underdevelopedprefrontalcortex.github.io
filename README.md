My work:

[Powerschool vs. Student Privacy](https://www.youthrights.org/powerschool-vs-student-privacy/) - NYRA blog post about the 2025 data breach of Powerschool that affected over 60 million students and about technology more generally.

[A Reintroduction to Youth Rights](video1.md) - Mediocre video generally introducing the concept of Youth Rights. Done without any rerecords, with a shoddy microphone, and it shows.
