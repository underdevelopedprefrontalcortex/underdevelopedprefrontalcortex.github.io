My work:
[Invisibrowse Technical Demo](https://invisibrowse.github.io/) - A website that uses DRM video to block screenshots and screen recordings, including by school monitoring extensions like GoGuardian. Currently a technical demo that can only browse Wikipedia, but that should change soon.

[Youth Rights Podcast Ep. 0: Introducing the National Youth Rights Association](https://youthrights.org/podcast) - I was one of 5 members in the first episode of the Youth Rights Podcast, and one of 2 members editing and publishing it.

[Powerschool vs. Student Privacy](https://www.youthrights.org/powerschool-vs-student-privacy/) - NYRA blog post about the 2025 data breach of Powerschool that affected over 60 million students and about technology more generally.

[A Reintroduction to Youth Rights](video1) - Mediocre video generally introducing the concept of Youth Rights. Done without any rerecords, with a shoddy microphone, and it shows.
